### Available Scripts

| `npm run build`       | Bundles the app for production into the `dist/` folder.                |
| `npm run preview`     | Serves the production build locally to preview before deployment.      |
| `npm run lint`        | (Optional) Lints the code for errors and style inconsistencies.        |

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server with hot-reloading enabled:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## üö¢ Deployment

The `npm run build` command will create a `dist` directory with all the static files needed for production. You can deploy this `dist` folder to any static hosting service.
